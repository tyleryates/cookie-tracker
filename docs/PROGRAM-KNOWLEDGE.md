## Digital Cookie Platform

### Key Features for TCMs

**Six tabs:** Dashboard, Orders, My Troop, My Troop Orders, Troop Cheers, Virtual Booths.

**Reports available:** All Order Data (complete order details — this is what the app imports), Initial Order, Cookie Badges, Rewards Selection.

**Troop Cookie Site:** TCMs can set up a troop-level site with QR code. Sales tracked separately from individual girl sales. Orders from the troop site appear with last name "Site".

### Payment Handling

Credit card payments through Digital Cookie do NOT go into the troop bank account. Instead, troops receive credit that reduces the ACH balance due at season end.

**Pay My Cookie Bill:** Recommended method for families to pay troop account remotely when cash can't be turned in.

### Access Issues

- Registration email goes to the email in MyGS account (may differ from Smart Cookies login).
- Members unsubscribed from emails won't receive registration email.
- Red X in Smart Cookies roster = member didn't sync to Digital Cookie (contact customercare@sdgirlscouts.org).

## Smart Cookies Platform

### Order Types

**Initial Order:** Placed before season (due Dec 12). Delivered on Delivery Day. Banking info required in Smart Cookies to pick up.

**Planned Orders (Cupboard Orders):**
- Available starting Jan 26 at 9 a.m. Due by 9 a.m. the day prior to pickup.
- Scheduled in one-hour windows, fulfilled first-come first-serve.
- Jan 29–Feb 4: Orders over 40 cases must be filled at warehouse or council cupboard.
- Cannot schedule back-to-back same-day appointments for 40+ cases at volunteer cupboards.
- Converts to C2T transfer after pickup confirmation.

**Transfer Orders:** T2G (troop to girl), C2T (confirmed planned order pickups).

**Damage Orders:** Report damaged product per council procedures.

**Virtual Cookie Share Orders:** Manual entry to give girls credit for Cookie Share packages. See section below.

### Financial Transactions

Two tabs: **Troop Transaction** (all troop financials, locked/non-editable, exportable) and **Girl Transaction** (per-girl payments, DC payments locked, TCM-entered payments editable).

TCMs must routinely post girl payments — girls/parents see amounts paid and balance due on the Digital Cookie dashboard.

---

## Virtual Cookie Share — When Manual Entry Is Required

Virtual Cookie Share orders are manual entries in Smart Cookies (Orders > Virtual Cookie Share) that give girls credit for Cookie Share packages. They count toward total packages sold and affect rewards.

### Requires Manual Entry

1. **Girl Delivery with Donation** — Customer orders cookies AND Cookie Share from a Girl Link. The cookie packages and financial transaction flow automatically, but TCM must manually create Virtual Cookie Share for the donation portion.

2. **Non-credit-card Cookie Share sales** — Cookie Share sold for cash/check outside Digital Cookie. TCM creates Virtual Cookie Share to give the girl credit.

### Does NOT Require Manual Entry

1. **Ship-only orders with Cookie Share** — Packages and financials flow automatically.
2. **Donation-only orders** — Packages and financials flow automatically.

### Process

1. Run "Pending Manual Cookie Share Report" in Smart Cookies (weekly during season).
2. Check the "Balance" column:
   - **Negative** = additional Cookie Share entries needed
   - **Positive** = Cookie Share entered by troop for cash/check sales
3. Create Virtual Cookie Share order (Orders > Virtual Cookie Share) for each girl's negative balance amount.
4. Verify via Girl Cookie Order Detail Report (filter "Girl Delivery with Donation").

Cookie Share entries display on the girl's Digital Cookie dashboard once created.

## Financial Procedures

### Payment Methods

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Cash | Most common for in-person. Do NOT accept bills > $20. |
| Credit Card | Via Digital Cookie only. Credits reduce ACH balance. |
| Third-party apps (Square, etc.) | Must use GSSD tax ID #95-1644585. Personal setup = taxable income. |
| Pay My Cookie Bill | Digital Cookie feature for remote payment to troop. |

Do NOT accept personal checks (GSSD does not reimburse returned checks or bank fees).

### ACH Payments

**First Payment (Feb 11):** Auto-debited from troop bank account, adjusted for DC payments received. If DC sales exceed the amount, a minimum $25 debit verifies the account. Contact reconciliation@sdgirlscouts.org by Feb 10 if funds unavailable. Cannot pick up more cookies until first payment is paid.

**Final Payment (Mar 11):** Auto-debited, adjusted for outstanding balances (if approved) and DC payments.

### Outstanding Balances

If a parent hasn't paid by March 12:
- Submit Outstanding Balance report online with documentation (M-3 receipts, communication records).
- Physical copies to SUCC by March 14.
- Troop may not be responsible up to $500 if properly documented; above $500, troop covers the difference.
- Do NOT use troop proceeds to cover unpaid funds.
- Do NOT accept payment after March 12 — direct parents to GSSD.

### Refunds

When troop refunds exceed amount due, GSSD issues refund after reconciliation (target: end of April).
