### Virtual Cookie Share Orders & Donations

Virtual Cookie Share orders are manual entries in Smart Cookies that give girls credit for Cookie Share packages sold through certain channels. These sales add to the girl's total packages sold and affect rewards eligibility.

**What Are Virtual Cookie Share Orders:**
- Manual entries that allocate Cookie Share packages to individual girls
- Created through Orders > Virtual Cookie Share in Smart Cookies
- Assign financial responsibility for Cookie Share packages to the girl
- Display on the Girl Dashboard in Digital Cookie
- Count toward total packages sold for rewards

**When to Create Virtual Cookie Share Orders:**

Virtual Cookie Share orders are required for specific types of Digital Cookie transactions:

1. **Girl Link Orders - Girl Delivery with Donation**
   - When a customer orders both cookies AND Cookie Share packages from a Girl Link
   - Financial transaction posts automatically for the full order
   - Cookie packages flow into Smart Cookies automatically
   - TCM MUST manually create Virtual Cookie Share order for the Cookie Share portion

2. **Non-Credit Card Sales**
   - Cookie Share packages sold and paid for outside Digital Cookie (cash, check)
   - Girl receives payment directly from customer
   - TCM must create Virtual Cookie Share order to give girl credit

**Donation Types That DO NOT Require Virtual Cookie Share Orders:**

These donation types from Digital Cookie automatically flow into Smart Cookies:

1. **Girl Link - Ship Only Orders**: Customer orders cookies and Cookie Share packages, but selects ship-only option
   - Packages and financial transactions flow automatically into Smart Cookies
   - No action required from troop

2. **Girl Link - Donation Only**: Customer orders donation only (no physical cookie packages)
   - Packages and financial transactions flow automatically into Smart Cookies
   - No action required from troop

**Process for Creating Virtual Cookie Share Orders:**

1. **Run the Pending Manual Cookie Share Report**
   - Navigate to Reports in Smart Cookies
   - Run the "Pending Manual Cookie Share Report" for your troop
   - Review weekly during cookie season to stay current

2. **Analyze the Report**
   - **Total CS from Girl Delivery w/Donation**: Cookie Share packages from Digital Cookie requiring manual entry
   - **Total CS not part of IO**: Total Cookie Share not included in Initial Order (for Direct Sales councils, this equals the Girl Delivery w/Donation column)
   - **Total Cookie Share Manually Entered**: Virtual Cookie Share orders already entered (does NOT include booth Cookie Share)
   - **Balance**: Difference indicating what action is needed
     - Negative balance = Additional Cookie Share packages need to be entered in Smart Cookies
     - Positive balance = Cookie Share orders entered by troop and paid outside Digital Cookie (cash, check)

3. **Create the Virtual Cookie Share Order**
   - Navigate to Orders > Virtual Cookie Share in Smart Cookies
   - Enter the number of Cookie Share packages sold by each girl (based on the negative balance amount)
   - Click Save
   - Orders can be entered incrementally as received or as one total at season end

4. **Verify Entries**
   - Run the Girl Cookie Order Detail Report
   - Filter for "Girl Delivery with Donation" to verify numbers
   - Confirm Cookie Share totals display correctly on Girl Dashboard in Digital Cookie

**Reconciliation Between Digital Cookie and Smart Cookies:**

The reconciliation process ensures accurate tracking of Cookie Share sales across both platforms:

1. **Digital Cookie Records**: Tracks customer orders, payment transactions, and donation types
2. **Smart Cookies Reconciliation**: TCM must manually reconcile Girl Delivery with Donation orders
3. **Pending Manual Cookie Share Report**: Primary tool for identifying discrepancies
4. **Weekly Review**: Best practice to review reports weekly during sale to keep current
5. **Impact of Errors**: If Cookie Share packages not correctly entered in Smart Cookies:
   - Girl's total packages sold will be incorrect
   - Affects girl rewards eligibility
   - Affects girl financial reports
   - Creates confusion for families viewing Digital Cookie dashboard

**Important Notes:**
- Cookie Share packages will display on Girl Dashboard in Digital Cookie once Virtual Cookie Share order is created
- Financial responsibility for these packages is assigned to the girl
- Totals from Smart Cookies display on Digital Cookie Girl Dashboard - keeping entries current prevents caregiver questions
- Virtual Cookie Share orders can be entered each time an order is received or as one total at end of sale

### Banking Requirements
- Banking information MUST be entered in Smart Cookies under Troop Information
- Troops without banking info cannot pick up initial orders
- Verify banking details before Delivery Day

### Allocation Process
- TCMs must create Troop-to-Girl (T2G) transfer orders to move cookies from troop inventory to Girl Scouts
- Direct ship orders from Digital Cookie automatically allocate (no manual entry needed)
- Proper allocation ensures accurate tracking of girl sales and balances

## The Girl Scout Difference

The Girl Scout Leadership Experience helps girls thrive in five key ways:

1. **Develop a strong sense of self**
2. **Seek challenges and learn from setbacks**
3. **Display positive values**
4. **Form and maintain healthy relationships**
5. **Identify and solve problems in their communities**

The inclusive, all-female environment creates a safe space where girls can try new things, develop skills, take on leadership roles, and just be themselves.
